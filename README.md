# Introduction
[Zhongmu][zhongmu] ("中目") is a website/JS-library allowing to systematically
inspect Chinese characters using external resources
(dictionaries, decomposition tables, etc.). In particular, we try
to make good use of various "open" resources.

This can be used on isolated characters, words, pieces of texts,
or complete works.

See [this article][tales-on-chinese] for more information about
why/how this can be useful.
